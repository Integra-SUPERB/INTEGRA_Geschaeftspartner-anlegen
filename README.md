# INTEGRA Geschaeftspartner anlegen

## Goal of this repository
Using the [Gesch√§ftspartner anlegen](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-anlegen) repository, you can request a new business partner. In Switzerland, both natural persons and juridical persons are considered business partners by the Swiss government. However, if you use this API, you are not actually creating a new business partner directly. Instead, you are sending a request to a team at the Federal Finance Administration (FFA). This team manages the master data and ensures that every person only exists once in the database. If your request is approved, a new business partner will be created.

**Attention!**  
Before you request a new business partner, please use the search function to find existing records.

## How does this API work?
Multiple links to the official sap documentation will help you understand the different parameters and necessary parts of information to use the API successfully. 

To provide a fast and easy reference, we recommend that you start by reviewing our [empty create request XML file](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-anlegen/blob/main/ExampleCreateRequestEmpty.xml). This file is intended to help you understand the structure and format of the request data that you need to provide in order to use the API.

The description for the replication of a business partner **inbound** is found here: [Replicate request in service.](https://api.sap.com/api/BUSINESSPARTNERSUITEBULKREPLIC/resource)

The replication **outbound** is handled here: [Replicate request out service.](https://api.sap.com/api/CO_MDG_BP_RPLCTRQ/resource)
